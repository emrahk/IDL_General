21 Jun 95:	Added keywords TITLE and SUBSCRIPTS to XMOVIE.

31 May 95:	Modified XLOAD to not use colors.tbl file.

20 Mar 95:	Added ORIGIN and SCALE keywords to TVAXIS.

20 Oct 94:	Modified TVAXIS and COLOR_BAR to be more flexible.

 7 Sep 94:	Added routine XBLINK

 8 Jun 94:	Further corrected bug so that movie width will be correct even
		if Motif would otherwise force it to be wider while loading.

20 May 94:	Corrected bug in XMOVIE that caused the first image to be
		slightly offset from the rest on Motif displays.  Disabled
		printing of display information for each image.

22 Apr 94:	Modified WDISPLAY to support Microsoft Windows.

28 Dec 93:	Modified XMOVIE to call WDISPLAY and EXPTV to display images as
		they are being loaded.  Added keywords RESIZE, NOEXACT, SIZE,
		SMOOTH, RELATIVE.

22 Dec 93:	Added TITLE keyword to WDISPLAY.

30 Nov 93:	Added waits in TVPOINTS between calls to CURSOR to avoid
		spurious points.

11 Nov 93:	Started keeping this list.  Earlier entries were derived from
		the file documentation headers.

 9 Nov 93:	Modified image display routines so that the data scales can be
		either positive or negative.

29 Oct 93:	Added keyword TWO to XLOAD.
		Added image value to displayed output of TVPROFILE routine.
		Fixed small bug in TVOUT.

22 Oct 93:	Added routine BYTSCLI, contributed by Mark Hadfield.  This
		allows the MIN intensity value to be larger than the MAX
		intensity value, so that the image is displayed in reversed
		video.  Modified FORM_INT and BSCALE to call BYTSCLI.

 3 Sep 93:	Modified so that images displayed with EXPTV and PUT can have
		data coordinates associated with them.  This involved changes
		in a number of routines, and a greater dependence on the
		routines in the SERTS graphics devices library.

		Modified CONTV so that it is no longer necessary for the
		overlaid contour plot and the original image to match pixel for
		pixel.

30 Aug 93:	Renamed GET_SUBIMAGE to TVSUBIMAGE.

		Added INIT and FIXED_SIZE keywords to TVBOX routine.

24 Jun 93:	Fixed small bug in PUT.
		Added call to ON_ERROR in SETIMAGE.

14 Jun 93:	Added support for monochrome (dithered) devices into BSCALE.

 3 Jun 93:	Changed TVZOOM so that one can optionally zoom into the
		original array, rather than the displayed image.  Other minor
		changes.

25 May 93:	Rewrote some routines to avoid a bug with HISTOGRAM in OpenVMS
		on an Alpha workstation.

20 May 93:	Modified to optionally select positions from a zoomed
		subportion of the whole image.

12 May 93:	Changed TVVALUE to use widgets when available.  This makes it
		compatible with IDL for Windows.
